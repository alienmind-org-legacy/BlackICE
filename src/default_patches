# default_patches
#
# Default patch file for BlackICE builds. This file is read from build.sh when
# building BlackICE. It's purpose is to define various patches to the CM7/CM9
# and/or BlackICE source base.
#
# Non-patch lines in this file must either be empty or have a '#' in the first column.
#
# Each patch is given on a separate line containing these fields, fields are
# separated by whitespace.
#  field 1 = <patch name>
#            This should be all upper case and it is used to create a script variable
#            of the form PATCH_<patch_name>. For example, if the name is TORCH the
#            variable controlling it will be PATCH_TORCH. The default is that any
#            patch defined in this file is enabled. If you want a patch to be disabled
#            set its variable to 0 in the .ini file, e.g. PATCH_TORCH=0.
#
#  field 2 = 'cm7', 'cm9' or 'blackice'
#            You must specify one of the above words without the quotes. This indicates
#            which code base you are patching. For example if you specify 'cm7' then
#            the path in field 4 is relative to ${CM7_DIR}.

#  field 3 = 'git' or 'diff'
#            You must specify one of the above words without the quotes. This indicates
#            the patch type. 'git' is for cherry-picking from git and 'diff' is for
#            a diff patch that is executed using the 'patch' command.
#
#  field 4 = path to actual patch file relative to the BlackICE 'ICEDroid/src/' directory.
#            In other words all patch files are expected to be in ${BLACKICE_DIR}/src.
#
#  field 5 = *full* directory to change into when applying the patch. Relative to
#            the ${CM7_DIR}, ${CM9_DIR} or ${BLACKICE_DIR}.
#
# Using the TORCH patch as an example we have
#  field 1 = TORCH
#  field 2 = cm7 = this is a CM7 source patch as opposed to a CM9 or BlackICE source patch.
#  field 3 = git = this is a cherry-pick patch instead of a diff patch.
#  field 4 = android_frameworks_base@FRAMEWORK_TORCH.git
#  field 5 = frameworks/base
#
# If multiple lines use the same patch name then all of those patches will be
# applied (or not applied) as a group. This is needed by some patches whose
# changes are in multiple projects.
#
# Some group patches might use both a git and a diff patch. Typically the git
# patch is used to throw away a previously patched version of a file before we
# try to patch again. If we didn't do this we will either get build errors or
# worse, the build succeeds, but is wrong.

# Define patches below

#-----
# Torch patch:
#   Long press HOME key on lock screen toggles the torch function.
#   ***Obsolete because CM7 changes break it. Use TORCH1.
#-----
TORCH  cm7  git  android_frameworks_base@FRAMEWORK_TORCH.git  frameworks/base

#-----
# Torch patch:
#   Long press HOME key on lock screen toggles the torch function.
#     - The 1st patch (.git) does a 'git checkout -f ...' to throw away the previous patch.
#     - The 2nd patch (.diff) applies differences to the file.
#   ***Obsolete because TORCH2 has a better implementation.
#-----
TORCH1 cm7  git  android_frameworks_base@FRAMEWORK_TORCH1.git   frameworks/base
TORCH1 cm7  diff android_frameworks_base@FRAMEWORK_TORCH1.patch frameworks/base

#-----
# Torch patch:
#   Long press HOME key on lock screen or security screen toggles the torch function.
#-----
TORCH2  cm7  git  android_frameworks_base@TORCH2.git       frameworks/base
TORCH2  cm7  git  android_packages_apps_CMParts@TORCH2.git packages/apps/CMParts

#-----
# BackLight Notification patch: Backlight turns on when email, etc is received.
# This patch has 2 parts because the changes apply to 2 different CM7 projects.
#-----
BACKLIGHT  cm7  git  android_frameworks_base@BACKLIGHT.git       frameworks/base
BACKLIGHT  cm7  git  android_packages_apps_CMParts@BACKLIGHT.git packages/apps/CMParts

#-----
# Carrier Custom Text: Allows suport for $n (newline), $d (default text),
# $p (plmn text) and $s (spn text) within the custom carrier text..
# This patch has 2 parts because the changes apply to 2 different CM7 projects.
